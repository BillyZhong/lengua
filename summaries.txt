At the BJP office today, a scuffle broke out and the police had to be called in to restore order after even Mr Upadhyay's attempts to pacify the agitated workers came to naught.
While the party says that Mr Upadhyay is being kept out of contesting elections so that he can supervise the campaign for the BJP, the move is being seen as an attempt to ensure that party workers do not have multiple command centres to focus on.The Congress is witnessing a similar upheaval, with many supporters of the Congress Delhi chief Arvinder Singh Lovely up in arms over the decision that he will not contest elections.
