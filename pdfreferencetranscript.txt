Some infected cells, such as those infected by
the common cold virus (rhinovirus), die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death
or “cell suicide”), releasing all the progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from
the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and
from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave
the cell individually. When a pathogen is recognized as foreign, chemicals called cytokines are released. A cytokine is a
chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production),
and gene expression to produce a variety of immune responses. Approximately 40 types of cytokines
exist in humans. In addition to being released from white blood cells after pathogen recognition,
these events of apoptosis and encourages the differentiation of different cells.  The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure,
or “crack,” is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually
the membrane and cell are cleaved in two (Figure 6.5). In plant cells, a cleavage furrow is not possible because of the rigid cell walls surrounding the plasma
membrane. A new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. Sexual reproduction, specifically
meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary
success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms can or must employ some
form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.
