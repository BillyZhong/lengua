# sandwich

Sandwich is a tool that aims to compress lectures and lecture notes into easily understandable tidbits. Using various forms of Natural Language Processing, Sandwich breaks down lectures into keywords related to the subject at hand, compiles related readings from around the internet, and provides relevant information about the subjects talked about in the lecture from provided materials like powerpoints and textbooks.

#How to Use Sandwich.

2. As per the instructions on the page, choose to either record a lecture in real time or upload a transcript of the lecture. In the future, you will be able to also upload an .mp3 of the lecture.
3. Once you have uploaded a copy of the lecture, you can choose to also upload powerpoints you have access to or pdf copies of textbooks you are using.
