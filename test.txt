Foundation Support OpenStax College is grateful for the tremendous support of our sponsors. Without their strong engagement, the goal of free access to high-quality textbooks would remain just a dream. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving peoples health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. Our mission at the Twenty Million Minds Foundation is to grow access and success by eliminating unnecessary hurdles to affordability. We support the creation, sharing, and proliferation of more effective, more affordable educational content by leveraging disruptive technologies, open educational resources, and new models for collaboration between for-profit, nonprofit, and public entities. The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science, education, sustainability, and other areas of social importance. /?8GK<I ?8GK<I 7>QBO #>O?LK?8GK<I #>O?LEVAO>QBP ,FMFAP 0OLQBFKP ?8GK<I ?8GK<I O>KPMLOQ O>KPMLOQ O>KPMLOQ?8GK<I(<K89FC@JD !OFMELPME>QB %KWVJBP?8GK<I 'IV@LIVPFP ?8GK<I+?FKFJPEK?<J@J ?8GK<I ?8GK<I ?8GK<I ?8GK<I-BKABIw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q?JJUFGJCCLAMSP?EGLEQAGCLACQRSBCLRQRMU?PBFGEFJCTCJQMD?A?BCKGA*LQRPSARMPQ?LBQRSBCLRQ?JGICUGJJDGLBRF?RRFGQRCVR@MMI MD0NCL4R?V$MJJCECGQ?MPE?LGX?RGMLAMKKGRRCBRMGKNPMTGLEQRSBCLR?AACQQRMOS?JGRWJC?PLGLE0SPDPCCRCVR@MMIQ?PCBCTCJMNCB?LBNCCP@WCBSA?RMPQRMCLQSPCRFCW?PC ?LBKCCRRFCQAMNC?LBQCOSCLACPCOSGPCKCLRQMDRMB?WsQAMJJCEC6LJGICRP?BGRGML?J 0NCL4R?V$MJJCECPCQMSPACQJGTCMLJGLC?LB?PCMULCB@WRFCAMKKSLGRWMDCBSA?RMPQ SQGLE5FPMSEFMSPN?PRLCPQFGNQUGRFAMKN?LGCQ?LBDMSLB?RGMLQAMKKGRRCBRMPCBSAGLEAMQRQ DMP0NCL4R?V$MJJCECGQUMPIGLERMGKNPMTC?AACQQRMFGEFCPCBSA?RGMLDMP0NCL4R?V $MJJCECGQ?LGLGRG?RGTCMD3GAC6LGTCPQGRW?LBGQK?BCNMQQG@JCRFPMSEFRFCECLCPMSQQSNNMPRMDQCTCP?J 0NCL4R?V$MJJCECPCQMSPACQNPMTGBCOS?JGRW?A?BCKGA5FPCCICWDC?RSPCQQCRMSPK?RCPG?JQ?N?PRDPMKMRFCPQRFCWA?L@CASQRMKGXCB@WGLQRPSARMPQDMPC?AFRFCW?PC?tJGTGLEu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tMNCLQMSPACuJGACLQCBSLBCP?$PC?RGTC$MKKMLQ"RRPG@SRGML5FCQAGCLRGDGAAMKKSLGRWGQGLTGRCBRMQS@KGRCKCPEGLE?LBMRFCPDCCB@?AIRMCLF?LAC?LBQRPCLERFCLRFCK?RCPG?J?LBICCN GRASPPCLR?LBPCJCT?LRDMPRMB?WsQ4S@KGRWMSPQSEECQRGMLQRM ?LBAFCAIGLMLCBGRGML?JRCPL?RC?LBLCUQMLRFC4R?V%?QF?R FJKGQBCQGELCBDMP@GMJMEWAMSPQCQDMPQAGCLAC*RGQEPMSLBCBML?LCTMJSRGML?PW@?QGQ?LBGLAJSBCQCVAGRGLEDC?RSPCQRF?RFGEFJGEFRA?PCCPQGLRFC@GMJMEGA?JQAGCLACQ?LBCTCPWB?W?NNJGA?RGMLQMDRFCAMLACNRQ?R5MKCCRRFCLCCBQMDRMB?WsQGLQRPSARMPQ?LB QMKCAMLRCLRF?Q@CCLQRP?RCEGA?JJWAMLBCLQCBUFGJCK?GLR?GLGLERFCMTCP?JJQAMNC?LBAMTCP?ECMD RP?BGRGML?JRCVRQDMPRFGQ*LQRPSARMPQA?LASQRMKGXCRFC?B?NRGLEGRRMRFC?NNPM?AFRF?RUMPIQ02%&
